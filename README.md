# Computer Vision 22/23 course assignments
Each assignment folder contains a **report.pdf** file which explains my solution and implementation in detail.

<p align="justify">Geometric camera calibration, also known as camera intrinsics calibration or multi-camera calibration, is the process of estimating the parameters required to relate (2D) points in a camera’s image plane with (3D) points in the world scene the camera is viewing. With a calibrated camera, each point on a sensor translates into a ray emanating into the scene, providing directional information about points in a scene.</p>
