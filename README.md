# Computer Vision 22/23 course assignments

You can find a **report.pdf** document detailing my algorithms and the corresponding implementations in each assignment's folder.
A visual result for [assignment 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_70cBssigg) and [assignment 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K0LduuL0rc) can be found on Youtube.

<h3>1) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/tree/main/camera_geometric_calibration">Camera Geometric Calibration</a></h3>

&nbsp;
<p align="justify">The main goals of this assignment are (1) to implement a camera calibration procedure (intrinsics and extrinsics), (2) to show how the calibration data can be used in real time for basic AR (Augmented Reality).</p>

<h3>2) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/tree/main/voxel-based_3d_reconstruction">Voxel-Based 3D Reconstruction</a></h3>

&nbsp;
<p align="justify">The main goals of this assignment are (1) to calibrate four cameras (intrinsics and extrinsics), (2) to do background subtraction for each view, and (3) to implement the silhouette-based voxel reconstruction algorithm.</p>

<h3>3) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/tree/main/color-based_voxel_labeling">Color-Based Voxel Labeling</a></h3>
<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/main/readme/color-label.jpg" width="330"> 
&nbsp;
<p align="justify">The main goals of this assignment is to (1) make a color model for each person offline and (2) label the voxels based on this color model in subsequent frames.</p>

<h3>4) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/tree/main/conv_neural_networks">Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h3>
<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/main/readme/fashion_mnist.jpg" width="330"/>
&nbsp;
<p align="justify">In this assignment, you will get hands-on experience in training and validating CNN models, and how to report the performance of the model. It acts as the foundation for the final assignment.</p>

<h3>5) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/tree/main/action_recognition">Action Recognition</a></h3>
<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gianmarcopicarella/cv-assignments-uu/main/readme/action_recognition.jpg" width="330"/>
&nbsp;
<p align="justify">The aim of this assignment is to classify actions (1) in still images and (2) in videos with CNNs. The focus is on transfer learning, with the additional use of optical flow and combination of CNN outputs. There are no constraints in terms of the number of layers or the type of the architecture. Again, weâ€™re not looking for the best performance, although you should aim at passing the baseline accuracy scores for each task.</p>
